My <a href="https://github.com/dbueno">github</a> usually has my latest software.

I wrote [Horn2VMT](https://github.com/dbueno/horn2vmt), which converts Horn
clauses into a transition system format, VMT.

I wrote a reasonably efficient SAT solver in pure Haskell: <a href="https://github.com/dbueno/funsat">funsat</a></li>

Other packages I've found useful:

* [SBSAT](http://www.cs.uc.edu/~weaversa/SBSAT.html)
